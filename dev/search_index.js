In the former case we can think of the regularizer as buying flexibility on the open market once providing it ourselfs becomes to expensive. For the latter we would need to think about potential products that can reasonably be offered/modelled in the stochastic program. E.g. we can not simply say we are offering the full flexibility potential as that is a quantity that is hard to evaluate.","category":"page"},{"location":"generated/flexibility_by_stochastic_programing/","page":"Main Story","title":"Main Story","text":"Given multiple energy systems that trade with each other we could try to analyze a market of such systems as well","category":"page"},{"location":"generated/flexibility_by_stochastic_programing/","page":"Main Story","title":"Main Story","text":"","category":"page"},{"location":"generated/flexibility_by_stochastic_programing/","page":"Main Story","title":"Main Story","text":"This page was generated using Literate.jl.","category":"page"},{"location":"generated/srcs/sp_model/","page":"Model","title":"Model","text":"using StochasticPrograms\nusing Random\n\n#\n\"\"\"\nDefault values of system parameters.\n- c_i - price of buying energy from the grid, Euro/kW\n- c_o - price of selling energy to the grid, Euro/kW\n- c_sto_op - price of operating storage.
